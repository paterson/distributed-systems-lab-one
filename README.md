# Distributed Systems Lab One

I am assuming this will be reviewed by SSHing into one of my VM's and running the client, which will communicate with the php server running on my other VM.

## Installation

  * SSH into my Base VM (IP Address: 10.62.0.92)
  * Run `go install github.com/paterson/firstlab` from anywhere on the VM.
  
## Run

  * Run `firstlab` (It'll be automatically in the PATH so will work from anywhere)
